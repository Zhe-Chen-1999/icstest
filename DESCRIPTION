Title: Tests for Informative Cluster Size in Cluster Randomized Trials
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:

Description: Provides model-assisted, randomization-based, and model-based tests 
    for detecting informative cluster sizes in cluster randomized trials. These 
    methods help researchers determine whether cluster size is associated with 
    treatment effects, which can bias standard analyses if not properly accounted 
    for.
